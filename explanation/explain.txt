    SYNTAX:
        (insert) -> "insert <id> <name> <grade>" To insert the student

        (delete) -> "delete" OR "delete <id>" The 1st use deletes all the students
                                              but the 2nd use deletes the student who has the <id> you passed

        (select) -> "select" OR "select <name>" The 1st use prints all the students info
                                                but the 2nd use prints only students <name> info

        (update) -> "update <id> <new_grade>" It find the student with the <id> you passed and changes 
                                              his grade with the <new_grade>

        (exit) -> "exit" Nothing special just exiting the program like that

        (cls) -> "cls" Also Nothing special just clears the terminal

        (count) -> "count" This is how you can see how many students have you added in the list

        (help) -> "help" If you type this command you will see 
                         all the commands without reading this documentation

NOTES: 
    CTRL + S signal is handed so the programs frees 
            the memory even if you dint get to the exit.

    The program uses Linked list for adding students
    so you can add as many as you want.

    The colors are not the same in every system or terminal configuration.

    The data is stored on a .txt file and parsed to the program every time
    the program runs so you can still use them. Syntax of storing data -> ID|Name|Grade

    the max characters for a name is 49.

    Students are getting sorted by the id Number
    by using the bubble sort algorithm so the program 
    is more clear when you want to print the students
