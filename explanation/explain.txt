    SYNTAX:
        (insert) -> "insert <id> <name> <grade>" To insert the student

        (delete) -> "delete", "delete <id>", "delete <op> <grade>"
                                              The 1st use deletes all the students
                                              The 2nd use deletes only the student with the <id>
                                              The 3rd use deletes all the students with <op> <grade>

        (select) -> "select", "select <name>", "select <op> <grade>" 
                                              The 1st use prints all the students information

        (update) -> "update <id> <new_grade>" It finds the student with the <id> you passed and changes 
                                              his grade into the <new_grade>

        (rename) -> "rename <id> <new_name>" it finds the student with the <id> you passed and changes

        (version) -> You dont have to pass any arguments, you just write that

        (exit) -> "exit" Nothing special just exiting the program like that

        (cls) -> "cls" Also Nothing special just clears the terminal

        (count) -> "count" This is how you can see how many students have you added in the list

        (average) -> "average" And after you write this you can see the average grade

NOTES: 
    CTRL + C signal is handed so the programs frees 
             the memory even if you dint get to the exit.

    The program uses Linked list for adding students
    so you can add as many as you want.

    The colors are not the same in every system or terminal configuration.

    The data is stored on a .txt file and parsed to the program every time
    the program runs so you can still use them. Syntax of storing data -> ID|Name|Grade

    the max characters for a name is 49.

    Students are getting sorted by the id Number,
    using the bubble sort algorithm so the program 
    gets more clear when you want to print the students from the list.

    You cant insert two students with the same name or ID
    Because the commands delete , select uses this datas as parameters
    and if two students have the same name or ID the program prints 
    or deletes the 1st of those two it finds, So we made insertion checking.
